/**
 * Security and Implementation Notes:
 * 
 * This implementation has been significantly improved, but for production:
 * 
 * 1. Use a proper database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) with Prisma or other ORM
 * 2. Use proper password hashing (bcrypt, which we now use)
 * 3. Implement distributed rate limiting (Redis)
 * 4. Use proper email verification flows
 * 5. Add two-factor authentication (TOTP or SMS)
 * 6. Implement comprehensive audit logging
 * 7. Configure proper security headers (CSP, etc.)
 * 8. Implement account lockout mechanisms
 * 9. Add robust error monitoring (Sentry, etc.)
 * 10. Consider using a WAF for additional security
