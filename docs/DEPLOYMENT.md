# Deployment Guide

## Build Status: ✅ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

All build errors have been fixed. The application builds successfully and is ready to deploy.

## Fixed Issues

1. ✅ Added missing `@supabase/ssr` and `@supabase/supabase-js` packages
2. ✅ Created missing `@/lib/supabase/client` module for Supabase browser client
3. ✅ Created missing `@/components/ui/enhanced-loading` component with LoadingSpinner and DashboardSkeleton
4. ✅ Created missing `@/lib/hooks/useCurrentUser` hook for authentication
5. ✅ Fixed TypeScript type errors in `use-admin.ts`

## Prerequisites

### Required Environment Variables

The application requires the following environment variables to be set:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. Fill in your Supabase credentials in `.env.local`

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

1. **Install Vercel CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy to production**:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Set environment variables in Vercel**:
   - Go to your project settings in Vercel
   - Navigate to "Environment Variables"
   - Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### Option 2: Deploy via Git Push

If your Vercel project is connected to GitHub:

1. Push your changes to the main branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Vercel will automatically deploy the changes

### Option 3: Other Platforms

The application is a standard Next.js 15 app and can be deployed to:
- Netlify
- AWS Amplify
- Cloudflare Pages
- Any platform supporting Next.js

## Build Verification

To verify the build locally before deployment:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Type check
pnpm check-types

# Lint
pnpm lint

# Build
pnpm build

# Start production server locally
pnpm start
```

All commands should complete successfully.

## Post-Deployment

After deployment, verify:

1. ✅ Application loads without errors
2. ✅ Supabase connection works (if configured)
3. ✅ All pages render correctly
4. ✅ Authentication works (if using admin features)

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Environment Variables

If you see errors about Supabase connection:
- Verify environment variables are set in your deployment platform
- Check that the values are correct
- Restart the deployment after adding variables

### Build Failures

If the build fails:
1. Check that all dependencies are installed: `pnpm install`
2. Verify TypeScript compilation: `pnpm check-types`
3. Run lint: `pnpm lint`
4. Check for any new errors in the build output

## Backend Deployment (Supabase)

For deploying the Supabase backend, use:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-to-production.sh
```

This will:
1. Verify local Supabase environment
2. Link to remote project
3. Push database migrations
4. Provide setup instructions
