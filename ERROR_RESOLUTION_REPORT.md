## 🐛 ERRORS RESOLVED

### **1. Import Module Resolution Errors** ✅ FIXED

**Original Errors:**

```
Cannot find module '../components/layout/ModernNavigation' or its corresponding type declarations.
Cannot find module '../components/sections/ModernHero' or its corresponding type declarations.
Cannot find module '../components/sections/ProvenResults' or its corresponding type declarations.
Cannot find module '../components/sections/BusinessMetrics' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**

- Components existed with proper exports
- Issue was related to TypeScript compilation cache/state
- Build process resolved module resolution automatically

**Resolution Method:**

- Verified all components have proper `export function ComponentName()` statements
- Confirmed file paths and extensions are correct
- Successful production build cleared any cache issues

### **2. Component Export Verification** ✅ CONFIRMED

**Verified Components:**

- ✅ `ModernNavigation.tsx` - Line 23: `export function ModernNavigation()`
- ✅ `ModernHero.tsx` - Line 10: `export function ModernHero()`
- ✅ `ProvenResults.tsx` - Line 38: `export function ProvenResults()`
- ✅ `BusinessMetrics.tsx` - Line 18: `export function BusinessMetrics()`
