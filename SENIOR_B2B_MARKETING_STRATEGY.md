## 1. CRITICAL ANALYSIS: HOMEPAGE MARKETING ATUAL

### 1.1 Problemas Fundamentais Identificados

**❌ MESSAGING DESALINHADO COM BUYER JOURNEY**

- **Problema**: Vender solução antes de estabelecer problema
- **Impacto**: Lead não vê relevância, bounce rate alto
- **B2B Reality**: CFOs precisam ver ROI antes de investir tempo

**❌ CONTENT HIERARCHY PROBLEMÁTICA**

- **Problema**: Technical features antes de business impact
- **Impacto**: Wrong audience attracted (developers, não decision makers)
- **B2B Reality**: C-level scan para business value, não technical specs

**❌ CONVERSION PREMATURA**

- **Problema**: CTAs agressivos sem value establishment
- **Impacto**: Low-quality leads, high sales cycle
- **B2B Reality**: Enterprise buying é consensus-driven, não impulse

**❌ FALTA DE SOCIAL PROOF CONTEXTUAL**

- **Problema**: Generic testimonials sem industry/size context
- **Impacto**: Não há peer validation, skepticism alto
- **B2B Reality**: CFOs compram peer proof, não vendor claims

### 1.2 Consequências para Sales Process

**LEAD QUALITY BAIXA**

- Prospects chegam sem context
- Sales precisa educar desde zero
- Ciclo de vendas longo e ineficiente

**POSITIONING CONFUSO**

- Não há clara diferenciação
- Competição por preço, não por value
- Commoditização do serviço

**ESCALABILIDADE LIMITADA**

- Dependência de sales individual
- Não há self-qualification do lead
- Crescimento linear, não exponencial
