npm run daily:plan

# Review context for day's priorities
npm run context:query "What should I prioritize today?"
```

### Throughout Day (as needed)

```bash
# For any decision
npm run context:query "Should I implement X or optimize Y?"

# For client work
npm run context:query "How should I approach this client requirement?"

# For business decisions
npm run context:query "How does this align with ARCO positioning?"
```

### VS Code Integration

1. **Ctrl+Shift+P** → "Tasks: Run Task"
2. **Select:** "ARCO: Get Context"
3. **Enter:** Your question
4. **Use:** Context appears in integrated terminal

### Weekly Review (10 minutes)

```bash
# Generate decision quality report
npm run decision:report

# Assess context system effectiveness
npm run context:test
```

## 🔄 MCP DECISION FRAMEWORK (July 7 Checkpoint)

### ✅ Continue Simple System If:

- Context system proves valuable in daily use _(expecting YES)_
- Client feedback validates improved quality _(TBD)_
- Sales conversations benefit from context _(TBD)_
- System performance remains excellent _(current: excellent)_

### ⚠️ Consider MCP If:

- Context becomes too complex for simple system
- Multi-agent coordination becomes necessary
- Real-time adaptation requirements emerge
- Business scale demands advanced automation

### 🎯 Focus on Business If:

- Context provides only marginal value
- Client acquisition remains primary bottleneck
- Resources better allocated to sales/marketing
- Simple documentation proves sufficient
