Installation & Setup
Step 1: Enabling the MCP server
Figma provides two ways to use the MCP server. Remotely using our hosted server, and locally using Figma's desktop app.

If you want to use our Remote server, there is nothing to enable, it's already on! To get the Local server set up, you'll need to follow the steps below.

Enabling the local server
Open the Figma desktop app and make sure you've updated to the latest version.
Create or open a Figma Design file.
In the upper-left corner, open the Figma menu.
Under Preferences, select Enable Dev Mode MCP Server.

You should see a confirmation message at the bottom of the screen letting you know the server is enabled and running.

[!TIP] The server runs locally at this location:

http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp

Keep this address handy for your configuration file in the next step.

Step 2: Set up your MCP client
Different MCP clients require slightly different setups to get connected to your MCP server. Follow the instructions below for your specific client to add the Dev Mode MCP server.

VS Code
Use the shortcut âŒ˜ Shift P to search for MCP:Add Server.

Select HTTP.

Copy the correct server url from below, and paste the server url in the search bar. Then hit Enter.

Remote server url - https://mcp.figma.com/mcp

Local server url - http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp

Type in Figma Dev Mode MCP when it asks for a Server ID, then hit Enter.

Select whether you want to add this server globally or only for the current workspace. Once confirmed, you'll see a configuration like this in your mcp.json file:

Using the Remote MCP Server	Using the Local MCP Server
{
  "servers": {
    "Figma Dev Mode MCP": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.figma.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}

{
  "servers": {
    "Figma Dev Mode MCP": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp"
    }
  }
}

Open the chat toolbar using âŒ¥âŒ˜B or âŒƒâŒ˜I and switch to Agent mode.
With the chat open, type in #get_code to confirm that the Dev Mode MCP server tools are available. If no tools are listed, restart the Figma desktop app and VS Code.
[!NOTE] You must have GitHub Copilot enabled on your account to use MCP in VS Code.

Other editors
Other code editors and tools that support Streamable HTTP can also connect to the Dev Mode MCP server.

If you're using a different editor or tool, check its documentation to confirm it supports Streamable HTTP based communication. If it does, you can manually add the Dev Mode MCP server using this configuration:

Using the Remote MCP Server	Using the Local MCP Server
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Figma Dev Mode MCP": {
      "url": "https://mcp.figma.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Figma Dev Mode MCP": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp"
    }
  }
}

Prompting your MCP client
The Dev Mode MCP server introduces a set of tools that help LLMs translate designs in Figma. Once connected, you can prompt your MCP client to access a specific design node.

There are two ways to provide Figma design context to your AI client:

Link-based
Copy the link to a frame or layer in Figma.
Prompt your client to help you implement the design at the selected URL.

[!NOTE] Your client won't be able to navigate to the selected URL, but it will extract the node-id that is required for the MCP server to identify which object to return information about.

Selection-based (local only)
Select a frame or layer inside Figma using the desktop app.

Prompt your client to help you implement your current selection.


Tools and usage suggestions
get_code
Use this to generate code for your Figma selection using the MCP server. The default output is React + Tailwind, but you can customize this through your prompts:

Change the framework

"Generate my Figma selection in Vue."
"Generate my Figma selection in plain HTML + CSS."
"Generate my Figma selection in iOS."
Use your components

"Generate my Figma selection using components from src/components/ui"
"Generate my Figma selection using components from src/ui and style with Tailwind"
You can paste links or select the frame or component in Figma before prompting.

get_variable_defs (local only)
Returns variables and styles used in your selectionâ€”like colors, spacing, and typography.

List all tokens used
"Get the variables used in my Figma selection."
Focus on a specific type
"What color and spacing variables are used in my Figma selection?"
Get both names and values
"List the variable names and their values used in my Figma selection."
get_code_connect_map (local only)
Retrieves a mapping between Figma node IDs and their corresponding code components in your codebase. Specifically, it returns an object where each key is a Figma node ID, and the value contains:

codeConnectSrc: The location of the component in your codebase (e.g., a file path or URL).
codeConnectName: The name of the component in your codebase.
This mapping is used to connect Figma design elements directly to their React (or other framework) implementations, enabling seamless design-to-code workflows and ensuring that the correct components are used for each part of the design. If a Figma node is connected to a code component, this function helps you identify and use the exact component in your project.

get_screenshot
This takes a screenshot of your selection to preserve layout fidelity. Keep this on unless you're managing token limits.

create_design_system_rules
Use this tool to create a rule file that gives agents the context they need to generate high-quality front end code. Rule files help align output with your design system and tech stack, improving accuracy and ensuring code is tailored to your needs.

After running the tool, save the output to the appropriate rules/ or instructions/ directory so your agent can access it during code generation.

get_metadata
Returns an XML representation of your selection containing basic properties such as layer IDs, names, types, position and sizes. You can use get_code on the resulting outline to retrieve only the styling information of the design you need.

This is useful for very large designs where get_code produces output with a large context size. It also works with multiple selections or the whole page if nothing is selected.

Dev Mode Local MCP Server Settings
These are additional settings you can toggle under Preferences and use with the MCP client.

Image settings

Use placeholder images: Skips image extraction and adds generic placeholders instead - helpful if you prefer swapping them manually in code.

Use local image server: Hosts images on a local server with URLs like http://localhost:3845/assets/89f254d1a998c9a6d1d324d43c73539c3993b16e.png.

Download: Saves images directly to disk.

Enable Code Connect

Includes Code Connect mappings in the response, so the generated code can reuse components from your connected codebase where possible.

As you use the Dev Mode MCP server, you may see a popup inside Figma asking you for feedback. To give us feedback, please use this form.

MCP best practices
The quality of the generated code depends on several factors. Some controlled by you, and some by the tools you're using. Here are some suggestions for clean, consistent output.

Structure your Figma file for better code
Provide the best context for your design intent, so the MCP and your AI assistant can generate code that's clear, consistent, and aligned with your system.

Use components for anything reused (buttons, cards, inputs, etc.)
Link components to your codebase via Code Connect. This is the best way to get consistent component reuse in code. Without it, the model is guessing.
Use variables for spacing, color, radius, and typography.
Name layers semantically (e.g. CardContainer, not Group 5)
Use Auto layout to communicate responsive intent.
[!TIP] Resize the frame in Figma to check that it behaves as expected before generating code.

Use annotations and dev resources to convey design intent that's hard to capture from visuals alone, like how something should behave, align, or respond.
Write effective prompts to guide the AI
MCP gives your AI assistant structured Figma data, but your prompt drives the result. Good prompts can:

Align the result with your framework or styling system
Follow file structure and naming conventions
Add code to specific paths (e.g. src/components/ui)
Add or modify code in existing files instead of creating new ones
Follow specific layout systems (e.g. grid, flexbox, absolute)
Examples:

"Generate iOS SwiftUI code from this frame"
"Use Chakra UI for this layout"
"Use src/components/ui components"
"Add this to src/components/marketing/PricingCard.tsx"
"Use our Stack layout component"
Think of prompts like a brief to a teammate. Clear intent leads to better results.

Trigger specific tools when needed
The MCP supports different tools, and each one provides your AI assistant with a different kind of structured context. Sometimes, the assistant doesn't automatically pick the right one, especially as more tools become available. If results are off, try being explicit in your prompt.

get_code provides a structured React + Tailwind representation of your Figma selection. This is a starting point that your AI assistant can translate into any framework or code style, depending on your prompt.
get_variable_defs extracts the variables and styles used in your selection (color, spacing, typography, etc). This helps the model reference your tokens directly in the generated code.
For example, if you're getting raw code instead of tokens, try something like:

"Get the variable names and values used in this frame."
Add custom rules
Set project-level guidance to keep output consistentâ€”just like onboarding notes for a new developer. These are things like:

Preferred layout primitives
File organization
Naming patterns
What not to hardcode
You can provide this in whatever format your MCP client uses for instruction files.

Examples:

Ensure consistently good output
## Figma MCP Integration Rules
These rules define how to translate Figma inputs into code for this project and must be followed for every Figma-driven change.

### Required flow (do not skip)
1. Run get_code first to fetch the structured representation for the exact node(s).
2. If the response is too large or truncated, run get_metadata to get the highâ€‘level node map and then reâ€‘fetch only the required node(s) with get_code.
3. Run get_screenshot for a visual reference of the node variant being implemented.
4. Only after you have both get_code and get_screenshot, download any assets needed and start implementation.
5. Translate the output (usually React + Tailwind) into this project's conventions, styles and framework.  Reuse the project's color tokens, components, and typography wherever possible.
6. Validate against Figma for 1:1 look and behavior before marking complete.

### Implementation rules
- Treat the Figma MCP output (React + Tailwind) as a representation of design and behavior, not as final code style.
- Replace Tailwind utility classes with the project's preferred utilities/designâ€‘system tokens when applicable.
- Reuse existing components (e.g., buttons, inputs, typography, icon wrappers) instead of duplicating functionality.
- Use the project's color system, typography scale, and spacing tokens consistently.
- Respect existing routing, state management, and dataâ€‘fetch patterns already adopted in the repo.
- Strive for 1:1 visual parity with the Figma design. When conflicts arise, prefer designâ€‘system tokens and adjust spacing or sizes minimally to match visuals.
- Validate the final UI against the Figma screenshot for both look and behavior.

# MCP Servers
## Figma Dev Mode MCP Rules
- The Figma Dev Mode MCP Server provides an assets endpoint which can serve image and SVG assets
- IMPORTANT: If the Figma Dev Mode MCP Server returns a localhost source for an image or an SVG, use that image or SVG source directly
- IMPORTANT: DO NOT import/add new icon packages, all the assets should be in the Figma payload
- IMPORTANT: do NOT use or create placeholders if a localhost source is provided

General quality rules
- IMPORTANT: Always use components from `/path_to_your_design_system` when possible
- Prioritize Figma fidelity to match designs exactly
- Avoid hardcoded values, use design tokens from Figma where available
- Follow WCAG requirements for accessibility
- Add component documentation
- Place UI components in `/path_to_your_design_system`; avoid inline styles unless truly necessary

Adding these once can dramatically reduce the need for repetitive prompting and ensures that teammates or agents consistently follow the same expectations.

Be sure to check your IDE or MCP client's documentation for how to structure rules, and experiment to find what works best for your team. Clear, consistent guidance often leads to better, more reusable code with less back-and-forth.

Break down large selections
Break screens into smaller parts (like components or logical chunks) for faster, more reliable results.

Large selections can slow the tools down, cause errors, or result in incomplete responses, especially when there's too much context for the model to process. Instead:

Generate code for smaller sections or individual components (e.g. Card, Header, Sidebar)
If it feels slow or stuck, reduce your selection size
This helps keep the context manageable and results more predictable, both for you and for the model.

If something in the output doesn't look quite right, it usually helps to revisit the basics: how the Figma file is structured, how the prompt is written, and what context is being sent. Following the best practices above can make a big difference, and often leads to more consistent, reusable code.

Bringing Make context to your agent
The Make + MCP integration makes it easier to take prototypes from design to production. By connecting Make projects directly to your agent via MCP, you can extract resources and reuse them in your codebase. This reduces friction when extending prototypes into real applications, and ensures that design intent is faithfully carried through to implementation.

With this integration, you can:

â€¢ Fetch project context directly from Make (individual files or the whole project) â€¢ Prompt to use existing code components instead of starting from scratch â€¢ Extend prototypes with real data to validate and productionize designs faster

How it works
[!NOTE] This integration leverages the MCP resources capability, which allows your agent to fetch context directly from Make projects. It is available only on clients that support MCP resources.

Steps to fetch resources from Make
Prompt your agent to fetch context by providing a valid Make link
Receive a list of available files from your Make project
Download the files you want to fetch when prompted
Example workflow
Goal: Implement a popup component in your production codebase that matches the design and behavior defined in Make.

Share your Make project link with your agent.
Prompt the agent: "I want to get the popup component behavior and styles from this Make file and implement it using my popup component."
Your agent will fetch the relevant context from Make and guide you in extending your existing popup component with the prototype's functionality and styles.
